# Calculator arguments

- `round` - MANDATORY: Round which time you want to calculate (1 - 255)
- `players` - MANDATORY: Amount of players you want round times for (1 - 4)
- `range` - OPTIONAL: Whether to print out round times up to provided round (0 - 1)

I didn't add any validation for those you'll just get weird results if you mess with numbers
